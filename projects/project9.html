            <p>PanoShop is a Rich Internet Application for use with an account on the ShopAlive platform. It runs on the user's local machine and directly creates changes in what can be seen in a browser and stored in the database associated with the account when the local system is connected to the ShopAlive backend servers via a broadband Internet connection.</p>
            <p>The ShopAlive platform permits any merchant to build and publish attractive and highly-engaging panoramic and 3D Web storefronts, and to manage all inventory, transaction and customer marketing/management aspects of a retail business.</p>
            <p>It offers a Web and mobile-friendly consumer-facing interface for a merchant's product catalog and showcase which encourages exploration and discovery, as the consumer would experience upon entering a "real" commercial space.</p>
            <p>Consumers are also customers. ShopAlive permits a merchant to build relationships with customers, to attract time and to promote new items to them under conditions which the customer chooses.</p>
            <p>But our story does not stop here. End users who like to build new Web sites using 3D or panoramic images, can also use our authoring software PanoShop, to explore their creativity and publish Web sites with panoramic and 3D interfaces.</p>
